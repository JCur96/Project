abstract = {The study of Quaternary environmental change is directly applicable to on-going issues of global conservation. Palaeoecological research techniques provide the tools to address some of the key questions presently being asked by conservation ecologists and land management organizations. But is this type of analysis currently being utilized to its full potential? Are the results of palaeoenvironmental analyses routinely applied to practical issues of natural resource management, and if not what can be done to expand the application of this research within the conservation community? This paper reviews recent developments in the application of the analysis of late Quaternary environmental change to key environmental issues of biodiversity and conservation management and examines areas which could be strengthened in the future including: (i) determination of baselines and natural ecosystem variability; (ii) understanding ecological thresholds and resilience; (iii) climate change conservation strategies; (iv) biological invasions; and (v) conservation and culture.},

abstract = {Natural history museums store millions of specimens of geological, biological, and cultural entities. Data related to these objects are in increasing demand for investigations of biodiversity and its relationship to the environment and anthropogenic disturbance. A major barrier to the use of these data in GIS is that collecting localities have typically been recorded as textual descriptions, without geographic coordinates. We describe a method for georeferencing locality descriptions that accounts for the idiosyncrasies, sources of uncertainty, and practical maintenance requirements encountered when working with natural history collections. Each locality is described as a circle, with a point to mark the position most closely described by the locality description, and a radius to describe the maximum distance from that point within which the locality is expected to occur. The calculation of the radius takes into account aspects of the precision and specificity of the locality description, as well as the m...},

@article{Willis2006,
abstract = {Ecosystems change in response to factors such as climate variability, invasions, and wildfires. Most records used to assess such change are based on short-term ecological data or satellite imagery spanning only a few decades. In many instances it is impossible to disentangle natural variability from other, potentially significant trends in these records, partly because of their short time scale. We summarize recent studies that show how paleoecological records can be used to provide a longer temporal perspective to address specific conservation issues relating to biological invasions, wildfires, climate change, and determination of natural variability. The use of such records can reduce much of the uncertainty surrounding the question of what is “natural” and thereby start to provide important guidance for long-term management and conservation.},
